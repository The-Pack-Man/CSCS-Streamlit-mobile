    "question": "Which of the following reactions is the primary cause of metabolic acidosis (i.e., the decrease in intramuscular pH during high-intensity, fatiguing exercise)?",
    "choices": [
      "ATP → ADP + Pi + H+",
      "pyruvate + NADH → lactate + NAD+",
      "ADP + creatine phosphate → ATP + creatine",
      "fructose-6-phosphate → fructose-1,6-bisphosphate"
    ],
    "answer_index": 0,
    "explanation": "ATP hydrolysis releases hydrogen ions, which directly lower muscle pH."

    "choices": [
      "phosphagen",
      "aerobic glycolysis",
      "fat oxidation",
      "fast glycolysis"
    ],
