    "question": "After a bout of resistance training, acute hormonal secretions provide all of the following information to the body EXCEPT",
    "choices": [
      "amount of physiological stress",
      "metabolic demands of exercise",
      "type of physiological stress",
      "energy expended"
    ],
    "answer_index": 3,
    "explanation": "Acute hormonal responses reflect stress magnitude, stress type, and metabolic demands, but they do not directly quantify total energy expended."

    "question": "Which of the following hormones enhance(s) muscle tissue growth?\n\nI. growth hormone\nII. cortisol\nIII. IGF-I\nIV. progesterone",
    "choices": [
      "I and III only",
      "II and IV only",
      "I, II, and III only",
      "II, III, and IV only"
    ],
    "answer_index": 0,
    "explanation": "Growth hormone and IGF-I support anabolic processes related to muscle growth. Cortisol is catabolic, and progesterone is not a primary driver of hypertrophy."

    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a function of growth hormone?",
    "choices": [
      "increase lipolysis",
      "decrease collagen synthesis",
      "increase amino acid transport",
      "decrease glucose utilization"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Growth hormone increases collagen synthesis, supporting connective tissue integrity. It also increases lipolysis, increases amino acid transport, and decreases glucose utilization."

  {
    "id": "ch04_q04",
    "question": "Which of the following hormones has the greatest influence on neural changes?",
    "choices": [
      "growth hormone",
      "testosterone",
      "cortisol",
      "IGF"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Testosterone has the strongest association with neural adaptations related to strength, such as motor unit recruitment and neuromuscular efficiency."

  {
    "id": "ch04_q05",
    "question": "What type of resistance training workout promotes the highest growth hormone increases following the exercise session?",
    "choices": [
      "Rest: 30 seconds; Volume: High; Sets: 3",
      "Rest: 30 seconds; Volume: Low; Sets: 1",
      "Rest: 3 minutes; Volume: High; Sets: 1",
      "Rest: 3 minutes; Volume: Low; Sets: 3"
    ],
    "answer_index": 0,
    "explanation": "Growth hormone responses are greatest with short rest intervals, high training volume, and high metabolic stress."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch04_q06",
    "question": "Prolonged exposure to elevated hormone concentrations most commonly results in which cellular adaptation?",
    "choices": [
      "upregulation of receptors",
      "downregulation of receptors",
      "increased hormone specificity",
      "enhanced second-messenger activity"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Chronic exposure to high hormone levels leads to downregulation, reducing receptor number and cellular sensitivity."

  {
    "id": "ch04_q07",
    "question": "Which hormone type exerts its effects primarily by binding to intracellular receptors and directly influencing gene transcription?",
    "choices": [
      "polypeptide hormones",
      "catecholamines",
      "steroid hormones",
      "protein hormones"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Steroid hormones are lipid-soluble, cross the cell membrane, and bind intracellular receptors to directly affect gene transcription."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch04_q08",
    "question": "Which of the following hormones relies on a second-messenger system to exert its effects?",
    "choices": [
      "testosterone",
      "cortisol",
      "growth hormone",
      "aldosterone"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Growth hormone is a peptide hormone that binds membrane receptors and signals via second-messenger pathways."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch04_q09",
    "question": "Which regulatory mechanism helps maintain hormonal homeostasis by reducing hormone secretion once adequate levels are reached?",
    "choices": [
      "positive feedback",
      "hormone specificity",
      "negative feedback",
      "receptor upregulation"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Negative feedback loops inhibit further hormone secretion once sufficient physiological effects have been achieved."

  {
    "id": "ch04_q10",
    "question": "An athlete experiencing chronically elevated cortisol levels is MOST likely to experience which outcome?",
    "choices": [
      "increased protein synthesis",
      "enhanced immune function",
      "increased protein breakdown",
      "greater insulin sensitivity"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Cortisol is a catabolic hormone that promotes protein breakdown and suppresses immune function during prolonged stress."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch04_q11",
    "question": "Which training variable manipulation is MOST associated with an acute anabolic hormonal environment?",
    "choices": [
      "long rest intervals with low volume",
      "short rest intervals with high volume",
      "maximal loads with extended rest",
      "low-volume technique-focused training"
