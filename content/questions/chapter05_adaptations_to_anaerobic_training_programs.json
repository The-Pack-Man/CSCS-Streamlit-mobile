    "question": "Which of the following adaptations occurs FIRST during the initial weeks of a resistance training program?",
    "choices": [
      "muscle fiber hypertrophy",
      "increased cross-sectional area",
      "enhanced motor unit recruitment",
      "increased pennation angle"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Early strength gains are primarily due to neural adaptations such as increased motor unit recruitment and firing frequency rather than hypertrophy."

  {
    "id": "ch05_q08",
    "question": "Which resistance training adaptation is MOST responsible for improvements in rate of force development?",
    "choices": [
      "increased muscle cross-sectional area",
      "increased tendon stiffness",
      "enhanced motor unit firing frequency",
      "fiber type hypertrophy"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Rate of force development is largely influenced by neural factors, particularly the speed and frequency of motor unit activation."

  {
    "id": "ch05_q09",
    "question": "Which of the following training variables is MOST critical for maximizing neural adaptations in anaerobic resistance training?",
    "choices": [
      "high volume with short rest intervals",
      "moderate load with slow tempos",
      "heavy loads with long rest intervals",
      "low load with high repetitions"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Neural adaptations are maximized by high-intensity loads (≥85% 1RM) with sufficient rest to maintain force output."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch05_q10",
    "question": "Which adaptation contributes MOST to increased force transmission following chronic resistance training?",
    "choices": [
      "muscle fiber hypertrophy",
      "improved neuromuscular coordination",
      "increased tendon stiffness",
      "enhanced capillary density"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Increased tendon stiffness improves the transmission of muscular force to the skeletal system, enhancing strength and power output."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch05_q11",
    "question": "Which of the following changes is MOST characteristic of functional overreaching (FOR)?",
    "choices": [
      "long-term performance decrement",
      "persistent mood disturbances",
      "short-term performance decrease followed by supercompensation",
      "chronic hormonal suppression"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Functional overreaching involves a temporary decrease in performance that is followed by improvement after adequate recovery."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch05_q12",
    "question": "Which resistance training adaptation is MOST reversible during periods of detraining?",
    "choices": [
      "neural efficiency",
      "bone mineral density",
      "muscle fiber cross-sectional area",
      "tendon stiffness"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Muscle hypertrophy is lost more rapidly during detraining compared to neural or skeletal adaptations."
