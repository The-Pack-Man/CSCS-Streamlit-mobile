    "question": "When compiling results from the volleyball team’s vertical jump testing, the strength and conditioning professional notices that most scores are similar, but there are three scores that are much higher than the rest. Which of the following measures of central tendency is most appropriate for this group?",

      "mean",
      "median",
      "mode",

      "median",
      "standard deviation",
      "percentile rank"

      "90% of similar athletes",
      "10% of similar athletes"
