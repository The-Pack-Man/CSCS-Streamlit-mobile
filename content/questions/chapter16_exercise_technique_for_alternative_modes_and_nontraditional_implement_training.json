    "question": "If during the tire flip the athlete’s hips rise faster than the shoulders during the initial pushing motion, what is an effective correction to give the athlete?",
    "choices": [
      "Start with a higher hip position.",
      "Keep the hips slightly below the shoulders in this position.",
      "Lift the tire upward instead of driving it forward.",
      "Push with the arms first."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Keeping the hips slightly below the shoulders promotes proper force transfer and prevents excessive forward lean."

    "question": "If a strong athlete incorporates only unilateral training into his or her program, what might the strength and conditioning professional expect to happen?",
    "choices": [
      "A bilateral facilitation will occur.",
      "A bilateral deficit will be developed.",
      "A reduction in bilateral asymmetries will occur.",
      "Only unilateral strength will increase."

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Exclusive unilateral training can reduce bilateral neural adaptations, leading to a bilateral deficit."

    "question": "With regard to core training, when is instability exercise best applied?",
    "choices": [
      "with untrained athletes who are relatively weak",
      "in trained athletes who are rehabilitating from an injury",
      "with trained athletes who are trying to optimize strength and power",
      "with untrained athletes who are new to the exercise"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Instability training is best applied during rehabilitation to restore neuromuscular control, not to maximize force production."

  {
    "id": "ch16_q04",
    "question": "Which of the following is a rationale for using variable-resistance training methods?",
    "choices": [
      "to accommodate the changing mechanical advantages associated with constant-loaded exercises",
      "to minimize force application throughout the full range of motion",
      "to increase the time spent decelerating during a lifting motion",
      "to keep the applied resistance constant during changes in joint angle"
    ],
    "answer_index": 0,
    "explanation": "Variable resistance accommodates the strength curve by matching resistance to mechanical advantage."

      "20%",
      "50%",
      "70%",
      "90%"

    "choices": [
      "elite Olympic weightlifter",
      "novice powerlifter",
      "soccer player returning from unilateral injury",
      "competitive bodybuilder"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Unilateral training is particularly beneficial for correcting asymmetries during return-to-play scenarios."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch16_q07",
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the bilateral deficit?",
    "choices": [
      "greater force production during bilateral movements compared to unilateral movements",
      "reduced force production during bilateral movements compared to unilateral movements",
      "equal force production regardless of movement pattern",
      "a loss of muscle mass due to asymmetrical loading"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "The bilateral deficit occurs when the combined unilateral force exceeds bilateral force output."
  },
  {
    "id": "ch16_q08",
    "question": "Which of the following resistance training methods MOST effectively overloads the terminal range of motion?",
    "choices": [
      "eccentric-only training",
      "variable-resistance training",
      "plyometric training",
      "instability training"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Variable resistance increases load where mechanical advantage is greatest, typically near lockout."

  {
    "id": "ch16_q09",
    "question": "Which of the following is a primary limitation of instability resistance training?",
    "choices": [
      "reduced muscle activation",
      "increased injury risk",
      "reduced force and power output",
      "inability to improve balance"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Instability training reduces the ability to generate high force and power due to compromised stability."
